          Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
          author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young
          wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron
          Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
          Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord
          Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the
          wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all
          wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). The series was originally
          published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and
          Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world
          are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy. A series of many genres,
          including fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story
          (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and
          romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and
          includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling,
          the main theme is death. Other major themes in the series include
          prejudice, corruption, and madness.

          Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the
          Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense
          popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They
          have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and
          are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As
          of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies
          worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and
          have been translated into eighty languages. The last four books
          consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
          with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the
          United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within
          twenty-four hours of its release. The original seven books were
          adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.
          Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was
          estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the
          highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the
          Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling. The
          success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise
          to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that
          premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in
          2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series
          with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films
          premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find
          Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively
          known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at
          several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.
