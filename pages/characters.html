                  As you might guess, is the series' protagonist. Rowling's
                  seven books focus on the magical and often perilous adventures
                  of this young bespectacled boy who is the son of James and
                  Lily Potter. He was orphaned as a baby and forced to live with
                  his maternal aunt, Petunia, and her husband Vernon Dursley and
                  cousin Dudley. Despite the Dursleys' attempts to hide his true
                  identity, Harry finally learns of his magical heritage on his
                  eleventh birthday when he is summoned to Hogwarts School of
                  Witchcraft and Wizardry. Once there, Harry quickly learns of
                  his fame in the magical community, as he is easily
                  recognizable by the lightning bolt-shaped scar on his
                  forehead.

                  (a.k.a. Tom Riddle) was once himself a student at Hogwarts. He
                  was a singularly gifted pupil of magic; however, he became
                  obsessed with studying the dark arts, leading him to become
                  the most feared wizard of all time. As the series' main
                  antagonist, Voldemort is responsible for many deaths in the
                  magical community, including those of Harry's parents. This
                  early encounter with the dark wizard is what gave Harry his
                  telltale scar and the nickname 'The Boy who Lived.'

                  to becoming a first-rate witch. Although she never quite
                  approves of the boys' misadventures, Hermione's quick wit is
                  often to thank for saving the friends from certain doom.
