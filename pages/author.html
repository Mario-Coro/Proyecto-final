                Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965. Dianne, her younger
                sister, was born almost two years later and Joanne’s earliest
                childhood memory is of Dianne’s arrival. She, her sister and her
                parents lived in Winterbourne, Gloucestershire, until Joanne was
                nine, when the family moved to Tutshill, near Chepstow. Joanne
                grew up surrounded by books as her mum and dad loved reading –
                she says, ‘I lived for books … I was your basic common-or-garden
                bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health
                spectacles.’ From an early age Joanne wanted to be a writer. She
                wrote her first book at the age of six – a story about a rabbit
                called Rabbit.
              </p>

              <p class="author__container-info-p2">
                Then when she was eleven she wrote a novel about seven cursed
                diamonds and the people who owned them. Joanne went to school at
                Wyedean Comprehensive School and then went on to study French
                and Classics at the University of Exeter. Her Classics studies
                would come in very handy later when she was thinking up all the
                spells in Harry Potter, some of which are based on Latin! J.K.
                Rowling first had the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a
                train travelling from Manchester to London King’s Cross in 1990.
                Over the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books
                of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and amassed a
                mountain of notes, many of which were on scraps of paper. She
                arrived in Edinburgh in 1993 with three chapters of Harry Potter
                and the Philosopher’s Stone in her suitcase. By now she had a
                baby daughter, Jessica, but she continued to write in every
                spare moment she could find. When Joanne had finished the
                manuscript, she sent the first three chapters to a number of
                literary agents, one of whom wrote back asking to see the rest
                of it. She says that it was ‘the best letter I had ever received
                in my life’. After finishing the first book and whilst training
                as a teacher, Harry Potter was accepted for publication by
                Bloomsbury. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone quickly
                became a bestseller on publication in 1997. As the book was
                translated into other languages, Harry Potter started spreading
                round the globe – and J.K. Rowling was soon receiving thousands
                of letters from fans. The Harry Potter books have since broken
                many records. In 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
                became the fastest-selling book ever, selling 2.65 million in
                the first 24 hours in the UK. The Harry Potter series is now
                published in 80 languages, and over 500 million copies have been
                sold across the world. J.K. Rowling has also written three
                companion volumes in aid of charity: Quidditch Through the Ages
                and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (in aid of Comic
                Relief and Lumos); and The Tales of Beedle the Bard (in aid of
                Lumos). In 2015 J.K. Rowling's 2008 Harvard commencement speech
                was published under the title 'Very Good Lives: The Fringe
                Benefits of Failure and the Importance of Imagination' (in aid
                of Lumos and university financial aid at Harvard). In 2012, J.K.
                Rowling’s digital company Pottermore was launched, which became
                Wizarding World Digital in 2019. Pottermore Publishing continues
                to be the global digital publisher of Harry Potter, Fantastic
                Beasts and the Wizarding World. J.K. Rowling has written a film
                script inspired by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, with
                the film due for release in Autumn 2016. In addition to J.K
                Rowling's collaboration on Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
                Parts I & II, an original new story by J.K.Rowling, Jack Thorne
                and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, she is also making
                her screenwriting debut with the film Fantastic Beasts and Where
                to Find Them, a further extension of the wizarding world, due
                for release in November 2016..
