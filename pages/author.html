          Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965. Dianne, her younger sister,
          was born almost two years later and Joanne’s earliest childhood memory
          is of Dianne’s arrival. She, her sister and her parents lived in
          Winterbourne, Gloucestershire, until Joanne was nine, when the family
          moved to Tutshill, near Chepstow. Joanne grew up surrounded by books
          as her mum and dad loved reading – she says, ‘I lived for books … I
          was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and
          National Health spectacles.’ From an early age Joanne wanted to be a
          writer. She wrote her first book at the age of six – a story about a
          rabbit called Rabbit. Then when she was eleven she wrote a novel about
          seven cursed diamonds and the people who owned them. Joanne went to
          school at Wyedean Comprehensive School and then went on to study
          French and Classics at the University of Exeter. Her Classics studies
          would come in very handy later when she was thinking up all the spells
          in Harry Potter, some of which are based on Latin! J.K. Rowling first
          had the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a train travelling from
          Manchester to London King’s Cross in 1990. Over the next five years,
          she began to plan out the seven books of the series. She wrote mostly
          in longhand and amassed a mountain of notes, many of which were on
          scraps of paper. She arrived in Edinburgh in 1993 with three chapters
          of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in her suitcase. By now
          she had a baby daughter, Jessica, but she continued to write in every
          spare moment she could find. When Joanne had finished the manuscript,
          she sent the first three chapters to a number of literary agents, one
          of whom wrote back asking to see the rest of it. She says that it was
          ‘the best letter I had ever received in my life’. After finishing the
          first book and whilst training as a teacher, Harry Potter was accepted
          for publication by Bloomsbury. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s
          Stone quickly became a bestseller on publication in 1997. As the book
          was translated into other languages, Harry Potter started spreading
          round the globe – and J.K. Rowling was soon receiving thousands of
          letters from fans. The Harry Potter books have since broken many
          records. In 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the
          fastest-selling book ever, selling 2.65 million in the first 24 hours
          in the UK. The Harry Potter series is now published in 80 languages,
          and over 500 million copies have been sold across the world. J.K.
          Rowling has also written three companion volumes in aid of charity:
          Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
          (in aid of Comic Relief and Lumos); and The Tales of Beedle the Bard
          (in aid of Lumos). In 2015 J.K. Rowling's 2008 Harvard commencement
          speech was published under the title 'Very Good Lives: The Fringe
          Benefits of Failure and the Importance of Imagination' (in aid of
          Lumos and university financial aid at Harvard). In 2012, J.K.
          Rowling’s digital company Pottermore was launched, which became
          Wizarding World Digital in 2019. Pottermore Publishing continues to be
          the global digital publisher of Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and the
          Wizarding World. J.K. Rowling has written a film script inspired by
          Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, with the film due for release
          in Autumn 2016. In addition to J.K Rowling's collaboration on Harry
          Potter and the Cursed Child Parts I & II, an original new story by
          J.K.Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne,
          she is also making her screenwriting debut with the film Fantastic
          Beasts and Where to Find Them, a further extension of the wizarding
          world, due for release in November 2016.
