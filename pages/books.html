            <h2>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h2>
            <p>
              Harry Potter spent ten long years living with Mr. and Mrs.
              Dursley, an aunt and uncle whose outrageous favoritism of their
              perfectly awful son Dudley leads to some of the most inspired dark
              comedy since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But fortunately
              for Harry, he's about to be granted a scholarship to a unique
              boarding school called THE HOGWORTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND
              WIZARDRY, where he will become a school hero at the game of
              Quidditch (a kind of aerial soccer played high above the ground on
              broomsticks), he will make some wonderful friends, and,
              unfortunately, a few terrible enemies. For although he seems to be
              getting your run-of-the-mill boarding school experience (well, ok,
              even that's pretty darn out of the ordinary), Harry Potter has a
              destiny that he was born to fulfill. A destiny that others would
              kill to keep him from.

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>
            <p>
              The summer after his first year at Hogwarts is worse than ever for
              Harry Potter. The Dursleys of Privet Drive are more horrible to
              him than ever before. And just when he thinks the endless summer
              vacation is over, a creature named Dobby the house-elf shows up
              issuing a grave warning to Harry not to go back to school or
              disaster will happen! Of course, Harry has to go back- and he does
              so in grand style, in a flying-car magicked by his friends Ron and
              Percy Weasley. But getting back to Hogwarts isn't the cure Harry
              expects it to be. Almost immediately a student is found turned to
              stone, and then another. And somehow Harry stands accused. Could
              Harry Potter be the long-feared heir of Slytherin? Harry and
              friends Hermione and Fred are stretched to their limits in a
              desperate fight against Draco Malfoy and his gang, the hideously
              stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockheart, the malevolent owner of
              the diary of Tom Riddle, giant spiders, and perhaps even...Hagrid!
              This is the book that proves J.K. Rowling is a talent that's here
              to stay!

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
            <p>
              For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an
              infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing
              thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir
              apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving
              only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's
              defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the
              Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at
              Hogwarts . . . he's at Hogwarts." Harry Potter isn't safe, not
              even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his
              friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in
              their midst.

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
            <p>
              Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard responsible for the deaths of
              Harry's parents, is growing stronger. At the Quidditch World Cup,
              Voldemort's signature Dark Mark appears in the sky over the
              stadium, causing pandemonium. The lightning-bolt-shaped scar on
              Harry's forehead is sporadically causing him agonizing pain, and
              he is also hearing disturbing voices. Harry realizes that all this
              is the result of a strong connection between himself and the Dark
              Lord, one that is putting him in grave danger. Back at Hogwarts,
              the students are getting ready for the upcoming Triwizard
              Tournament. Witches and wizards from two other schools are coming
              to Hogwarts for the year to compete in a series of grueling
              contests. The tournament is open only to students age 17 and
              above, but when someone secretly enters Harry's name, he is forced
              to compete. How can a 14-year-old possibly pass tests that might
              be fatal to an advanced wizard? And with the threat of Lord
              Voldemort looming, will he be able to focus on the tournament at
              all? For Harry, his friends, and everyone in the Wizarding world,
              the stakes are about to become much higher. This fourth
              installment, with a heart-pounding and emotional climax, serves as
              a turning point in the series, for the reader and for Harry
              himself.

            <p>
              It's official: the evil Lord Voldemort has returned. His influence
              is suddenly everywhere in the Wizarding world, and his former
              allies, the Death Eaters, are returning to his side in droves. In
              response, the Order of the Phoenix, which worked to stop him
              during his last rise to power, has reconvened. This time, all of
              the adults Harry trusts have joined in. And even though Harry is
              at the center of many of their plans - Voldemort is intent on
              killing him, after all - they want so badly to protect him that
              they are keeping him completely out of the loop. Problems are
              cropping up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are
              meddling in just about everything. And just because Voldemort and
              the Death Eaters are threatening open warfare does not mean that
              fifth-year students get out of their exams. Meanwhile, Harry's
              powerful connection to Voldemort seems to be growing even
              stronger, as he realizes that he has direct access to the Dark
              Lord's mind. It's time for Harry and his friends to take drastic
              action, but the course they choose will have terrible unforeseen
              consequences. Truly dangerous times have arrived in the fifth
              Harry Potter novel, but it never loses the trademark fun,
              excitement, and wonder at the possibilities of magic.

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
            <p>
              The war against Voldemort is not going well: even Muggle
              governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of The
              Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent
              from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the
              Phoenix has already suffered losses. And yet... As in all wars,
              life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a
              few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their
              business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are
              never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary
              help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. So it's the home front
              that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of
              the story of Harry Potter. Harry struggles to uncover the identity
              of the Half-Blood Prince, the past owner of a potions textbook he
              now possesses that is filled with ingenious, potentially deadly,
              spells. But Harry's life is suddenly changed forever when someone
              close to him is heinously murdered right before his eyes. With
              Dumbledore's guidance, he seeks out the full, complex story of the
              boy who became Lord Voldemort, and thereby attempts to find what
              may be his only vulnerability

            <h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h2>
            <p>
              It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best
              friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore
              has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark
              wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to
              figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their
              cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the
              answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same
              time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong
              are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate
              battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of
              the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at
              Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute
              twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic,
              and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense,
              cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the
              heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more
              than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.
